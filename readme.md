### Assumptions
1. Contractions such as "I'm" or "you've" are considered one word
2. When a file contains multiple most used words of the same quantity, all of them are surrounded
3. Multiple case styles of a word are considered to be the same word
4. Punctuation makrs are not considered to be the part of the words and are ignored

### System requirements
* Node.js 8.11 runtime
* yarn

### Building
`yarn && yarn build`

### Demo
`yarn start`

### Technology stack
* Node.js
* Express.js
* React
* TypeScript
* Webpack

### Motivation
The following tools/technologies are meant to provide a simple developmet workflow, fast and flexible code.
#### JavaScript/TypeScript
JavaScript is powerful and flexible but it's not type-safe. TypeScript is typed superset of JavaScript. It provides type checking during compile time which significantly reduces the chances for bugs and results in more readable code.
#### React
React is a declarative JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is very simple to use and very fast to get up and going. It has a huge community beind and an enormous selection of already existing solutions for many different problems.
#### Node.js
Using Node.js for a web based projects reduces the number of different tools required for development. It is easy to write cross-platform code and it has a package manager to simplify managing the project dependencies. It enables the developers to reuse code and ideas both on the server-side and in the browser.
#### Express.js
Express.js is a fast and flexible web application framework running on top of Node.js. A simple HTTP server can be set up in just a couple of lines. The software interface is easy and intuitive. Additional functionality can be easily implemented using middlewares.
#### Webpack
Webpack is a popular module bundler for JavaScript applications. It supports both the browser and Node.js. It supports differend profiles for development and production. It is extensible with plugins to achieve flexibility.
